        <h3>Welcome to Orange Management developer page</h3>

<p>Orange Management aims for a lightwight, fast and simple solution for small businesses, groups and organisations. The goal is to create a easy to modify and extend system that replaces multiple software solutions with just one. By designing it as a web-based solution everyone can use this software on every device wherever they are. Possible clients would be</p>

<ul>
  <li>Small to mid sized business</li>
  <li>All types of organizations</li>
  <li>Educational Facilities</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything that is required to run the core software would be a webserver with PHP, and a client that can use JavaScript.</p>

<h3>Modules</h3>

<p>We are planning to ship multiple modules with this software that can be installed ontop of the core. Clients and individuals can extend modules or create their own modules by following a simple procedure. Clients will be able to hand-pick their modules/extensions an pay a minimal fee for them. This allows clients to control their costs by only paying for what they need. </p>
